# Prerequisites overview

-   Go to [Ilias MK68](https://ilias.uni-giessen.de/goto.php?target=crs_321994&client_id=JLUG).

# The Population

-   See: Ch. 1.3.3 Sampling from a population in [@Diez2022]

## The Population

-   "... is a natural, geographical, or political collection of people, animals, plants, or objects"

-   "... is the **physical collection**, ... from which **we derive a set of values or the variable of interest**"

-   specific to our **research question** and **the research design**

-   defines the scope of out study.

-   has quantifiable characteristics: true levels.

## Examples of a population by research questions 

Discuss what are the (1) populations; (2) variables of interest; (3) true population value of the parameter based on the exemplary research questions below:

1.  What is the average poverty headcount rate in the world?
2.  What is the average wheat yield in 100 kg per ha?

## Examples of a population by research questions 

::: {.smaller}
::: {.nonincremental}

At home, consider following research questions:

-   How does access to education impact income inequality?
-   What are the factors influencing malnutrition rates among children in a specific region?
-   How does access to clean water and sanitation facilities impact child mortality rates?
-   What are the barriers to accessing healthcare services among marginalized communities?
:::
:::

. . .

**How to actually answer such research questions?**

::: notes
1.  all people/households.

2.  wheat-producing farmers in the EU.

3.  individuals from different income groups in a specific region or country.

4.  Children under the age of five in the targeted region.

5.  Children under the age of five in areas with varying levels of access to clean water and sanitation.

## The power of a random sample

If every sample is unique, why random sample is so important?

. . .

A sample can approximate the population

-   **when its size (**$N$) increases to infinity!

. . .

This is the **Law of Large Numbers** (LLN)!

. . .

LLN makes random samples a powerful tool for understanding the population.

## Law of Large Numbers: limitation

Sampling is costly: Larger sample size = larger expenses.

. . .

Each sample is still a random draw!

-   Can we be sure that our sample estimates the right average?

-   If a population has minorities, how accurately can a random sample represent them?

## Simple sample limitations (3)

Key problems:

-   The population may contain underlining structures: **strata** / **clusters**.

-   Non-response may occur;

-   Convenience-sample may take place:

    -   where individuals who are easily accessible are more likely to be included in the sample.

-   Any such limitation causes our sample to be not **representative** or to contain **measurement errors**.


## Solutions:

### Advanced sampling techniques

Those exist to balance between data quality and data collection costs.

## Stratified sampling

![](img/stratified-sampling.png)

The population is divided into groups **strata**.

-   strata combines **similar cases** especially with respect to response variables;

-   within-strata: simple random sampling

-   Malaria rate example in jungles. 30 villages. What is the strata here? - no strata.
:::

## Cluster sampling

![](img/cluster-sampling.png)

-   Population is broken into clusters (by location usually).

-   We randomly select several clusters and sample them completely.

# Populaiton and samples by research question

1.  What is the average poverty headcount rate in the world/a country?

    -   Population: people or households;
    -   Sample examples: household surveys. 
    -   Data source: The Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) <https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/lsms>
. . .

**At home:** discuss the same for other research questions mentioned earlier.

# Population and sampling: summary

-   **Research objectives** are to **conclude about the population**.

-   But the population is **never available**, instead **we have RANDOM samples**.

-   Random samples are all different: result with different estimates.

    -   Thus, descriptive statistics based on each sample is not identical to one based on the population.

. . .

# How to conclude about population using random samples and statics?

-   Any ideas?

-   There are:

    -   Descriptive statistics
    
    -   Inferential statistics

## Descriptive statistics

-   AKA Data Analysis:

    -   uses statistical methods to described observed data (data that comes from samples)

-   But because each sample has a random component and is different from the population,

    -   **descriptive statistics** does not tell us much about the **population**...

## Inferential statistics

-   Answers questions **about the population** using:

    -   the **sample**, and
    
    -   **probability theory**

-   The science of using probability to make decisions [@Dowdy2004]

-   Does so by:

    -   Establishing **statistical hypothesis;**

    -   Using statistical methods and probability theory to **reject** of **accept** such hypothesis;

## The process of statistical inference

::: footer
Source: [@Dowdy2004]
:::

![](img/stat-inference.png)

. . .

Statistical inference is based on **statistical hypothesis testing** (HT).


## Statistical hypothesis: basics (1)

As we rely on a samples,

-   we call any computed measure (such as mean, median, variance):

    -   **the estimate of** {$\text{mean}$, $\text{median}$, $\text{variance}$}.
    -   we denote estimates with a "hat" "$\widehat{\; \; \; \;}"$
    -   for example: {$\widehat{\text{mean}}$, $\widehat{\text{median}}$, $\widehat{\text{variance}}$}
    -   Based on any sample we can **estimate** sample $\widehat{\text{mean}}$, $\widehat{\text{median}}$, $\widehat{\text{variance}}$
    

## Statistical hypothesis: basics (2)

To infer that {$\text{mean}$, $\text{median}$, $\text{variance}$} in the population is similar to **the estimate of** {$\widehat{\text{mean}}$, $\widehat{\text{median}}$, $\widehat{\text{variance}}$}, we:

::: incremental
2.  **formulate two statistical hypothesis**:

    -   **H0** (the null hypothesis):

        -   "**The estimate of {... ... ...} is equal to ZERO in the population**".

    -   **H1** (the alternative hypothesis):

        -   "**The estimate of {... ... ...} is NOT equal to zero in the population**".
:::

## Statistical hypothesis: basics (3)

::: incremental
3.  use statistical tests and the probability theory to reject **H0** (or fail to reject H0) and conclude:

    -   We reject **H0** concluding **H1**:

        -   with the probability $P$ (p-value) that we've made a mistake by rejecting H0 (Type I error).

    -   We accept **H0**

        -   because available data is insufficient to reject it;
        -   without implying that H0 is the right hypothesis (Type II error);
:::

## Goals of the Part 2: Quantitative Research Methods

::: incremental
-   Grasp the difference between description and inference.

-   Learn how to:

    -   apply basic methods of descriptive statistics, and

    -   perform statistical inference.

    -   concludes based on their results.

    -   communicate consistent stories

## Research question

### Do extension services in agriculture improve rice yields in "a province" of Vietnam?

::: incremental
-   The population: **all rice producers in "a province" of Vietnam**.

-   The variables: **rice yields in tons/ha** and **amount and quality of extension services received**.
:::

## Research Design (simplified)

### Randomized Control Trial (RCT) experiment:

-   Divide population into **clusters** and **strata**.

-   **Clusters** are similar in structure but are located in different places: **villages**

    -   Treatment group: 4 clusters with extension services.
    -   Control group: 4 clusters without such.

-   Same **strata** are present in each cluster: **small, medium, and large farmers**.

    -   **Stratified Simple Random Sampling of 200 farmers** in each cluster **proportionally representing all strata**.

-   Final sample size 1600 observations.

::: notes
Two stage sampling:

1.  Stage 1: 8 random clusters. Sample size depends on the population of clusters. 4/4 treatment/control.

2.  Stage 2: Stratified sample of 200.
:::

## Data Collection: Two waves

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: fragment
### Wave 1: pre-intervention
:::

::: incremental
-   Exist to establish the baseline;

-   Establish the **check and balance tables**

    -   To ensure that **on average, treatment and control groups are similar**.
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: fragment
### Wave 2: post-intervention
:::

::: incremental
-   Exist to check the hypotheses.

-   Collects data on the variables of interest.
:::
:::
:::

## Data analysis

1 year after the treatment, we repeat data collection and measure rice yields:

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### [Treatment group]{.fragment fragment-index="2"}

[Response rate: 1483]{.fragment fragment-index="3"}

[Rice yields: 6.0 tone per ha]{.fragment fragment-index="4"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### [Control group]{.fragment fragment-index="2"}

[Response rate: 1542]{.fragment fragment-index="3"}

[Rice yields: 5.8 tone per ha]{.fragment fragment-index="4"}
:::
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index="5"}
### Can we conclude extension services have a positive effect on the rice yields in Vietnam?
:::

. . .

Let us see what rice yields looks like in the world: <https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/rice-yields>

. . .

To conclude about the effect of intervention, we need to 

-   "embrace" the uncertainty!
-   perform statistical inference, 
-   consider **Variance** not only point-estimates.
