# The Univariate Data

-   Data that consists of a **single variable**.

-   **Univariate data analysis**:

    -   descriptive analysis of a single variable.

-   What measures are used to describe a variable?

    -   Central Tendency
    -   Variance

# The Central Tendency

-   It is a single value that describes where values $\{x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_n\}$ of a variable $x$ cluster around

-   Most commonly measures are:

    -   Median;
    -   Mode;
    -   Arithmetic Mean;
    -   Weighted Mean;
    -   [Other measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_tendency) of the center;

## Individuals' consumption of nutrients in the DR Congo {.smaller}

-   We use the survey of 395 individuals from the Democratic Republic of Congo;
-   It covers daily consumption of key nutrients and energy intake by population:
-   Key variables are
    -   `ENERGY_kcal` - energy consumption in kilo calories per day;
    -   `PROTEIN_g` - protein consumption in grams;
    -   `FAT_g` - fat consumption in grams;
    -   `HEIGHT` and `WEIGHT` respondents height and weight in cm and kg respectively;
    -   `SEX` - dummy variable that is 1 when respondent is a female and 0 if it is a male;
-   Data source: "FAO/WHO GIFT \| Global Individual Food" survey data [available here](https://www.fao.org/gift-individual-food-consumption/data-and-indicator/en/).

```{r}

  read_rds() %>%

      PROTEIN_g = c(rnorm(nnew, 300, 50)),
      CARBOH_g = c(rnorm(nnew, 1220, 250)),
      FAT_g = c(rnorm(nnew, 250, 80)),
      SEX = sample(c("Male", "Female"), nnew, replace = T),
      AREA_TYPE = sample(c("Rural", "Urban"), nnew, replace = T)
      )
    )
```

## Distributions

  congo_food %>% 
  mutate(SEX = ifelse(SEX == "Female", 1, 0)) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    c(ENERGY_kcal, PROTEIN_g, FAT_g, CARBOH_g),

## The Arithmetic Mean (The Mean)

::: callout-important
$$
\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N {x}_i}{N},
$$

where,


::: nonincremental

-   $\bar{x}$ is the central value of $x$, $x$ could take any values.

-   $N$ is the total number of observations.
:::
::: 

-   The Arithmetic Mean is affected by the outliers and may be misleading if the distribution is skewed.

Arithmetic mean is very sensitive to the extreme or outlining observations and skewed distributions.

Population may contain extreme values of $x$, however, when such appear in the sample, the may substantially bias our estimates.
:::
:::

## Dealing with extreme observations

::: incremental
1.  Document:

    -   Why?
    -   Describe why such extreme observation occurred.

2.  Analyze:

    -   Measurement error? Is this the true incidence in the population or an entry error? Is this a systematic entry error?
    -   Sampling error? Is this observation prevalent in the population or is this a random sampling error? Is it systematic?

3.  Keep, adjust statistical method, and generalization level:

4.  Remove only in exceptional cases
:::

## The Weighted Average (The Weighted Mean)

::: callout-important
$$
\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N {x}_i w_i}{\sum_{i=1}^N w_i},
$$

where,

::: nonincremental
-   $\bar{x}$ is the **estimate** of the central value of $x$, $x$ could take any values.
-   $N$ is the total number of observations.
-   $x$ is the weight that each observation has in the data.
:::
:::

::: incremental
-   the arithmetic average is essentially a weighted average, where the weight of each observations is equal to 1.
:::

## The Weighted Average example

::: incremental
Let us measure the level of extreme poverty in the World.

-   poverty is the state of livelihood when by income or consumption individual is living below the poverty line;

-   it measures:

    -   the % of people that by their income (or consumption) live below **a poverty line**,

    -   poverty line **per person per day** is country-specific or international in the international currency (e.g. [Purchasing Poverty Parity - PPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity))

-   extreme poverty is the poverty level given extremely low poverty line of 2.15 US\$ PPP per day.

-   Is any of those the right measure of poverty?

-   Can we use any of those?

-   ::: callout-important
    Neither of those is correct because every country has a different size.

## Average extreme poverty in the world (2)

::: fragment
1% extreme poverty rate in China (1.4B people):

-   implies 14 million people living in poverty.
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: fragment
49% poverty in Turkmenistan (6.1 M people):

-   is 3 million people living in poverty.
:::
:::
:::

::: incremental
-   The arithmetic mean of these two is:

    -   (1 % + 49 %) / 2 = 25 %;
    -   but, 25% of their total population is 0.25 \* 1.406B = 351.5 M...

-   Arithmetic mean implies that there is 351.5 M people living in poverty, but the sum of the number of poor people is 14M + 3 = 17.05M people.
:::

## Average extreme poverty in the world (3)

-   Arithmetic means, **without accounting for the size/weight** of the country measures of the central tendency of poverty inappropriately.

::: incremental
-   We must weight country-specific poverty level by the country's population.

-   Other examples, where weighting is essential:

    -   Analysis of the representative Individuals/Household surveys with the population weights.

    -   Macro-level data aggregation.

## Exam problems on the central tendency (DIY) {.smaller}

-   When the mean may not be the best measure of the central tendency in our data?

-   What measures of the central tendency we most often apply in social sciences?

-   The estimated arithmetic mean of the household size in our survey of 22 observations is 7.5 person, while the median size is 4.

    -   Which measure of the central tendency would you use to describe the average family size?
    -   Why do you suggest using this measure?
    -   What is the total number of individuals (not households) that is represented in our survey?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### At home: a complex question on central tendncy {.smaller}

::: callout-note
A representative household survey was collected from the population of all households in the country. Data contains many variables on various socioeconomic measures of the household along with the variable "Population weights".

-   What do those "Population weights" mean?

-   How using the weighted statistics by "Population weights" may change estimates of the central tendency?

-   What difference the weighted and non-weighted mean makes for the conclusions and generalization of the estimates of the central tendency?
