# Ceteris paribus

-   Watch again: [Ceteris Paribus: Public vs. Private University](https://youtu.be/iPBV3BlV7jk)

## Ceteris paribus I: RCT (1) {.smaller}

RCT - Randomized Control Trial (watch [Randomized Trials: The Ideal Weapon](https://youtu.be/eGRd8jBdNYg)!!!)

::: {.fragment fragment-index="1"}
-   The treatment is assigned randomly in a controlled environment where all other things remain fixed.
:::

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment fragment-index="2"}
### Treatment group

-   **a random sample** from a population, where **a treatment** is assigned.
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment fragment-index="3"}
### Control group

-   **random sample** from a population, **without any treatment**.
:::
:::
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index="4"}
### The Law of large numbers says:

-   Both, the treatment and control groups are on average the same as they are sampled from the same population.

-   The only difference between the two samples is the fact of treatment.

## Ceteris paribus I: RCT (2)

Experiments are often **not available**, **costly**, **sometimes unethical**, and often illegal.

::: incremental
Think, about how to make experiments to estimate the effects of:

-   years of schooling on earning?

-   additional child on mother's employment?

-   army service on the job perspective?

-   electronics (phones/laptops) in class on students performance?

-   health insurance on health
:::

## Ceteris paribus II: Regression

When experiments are not possible, **econometric methods** come to our rescue.

::: fragment
### Regression

::: incremental
-   **regressions** control the effects of other factors in the **causal effect of interest**.

-   **regression** contains **multiple variables**, which **represent measurable** and **approximate not measurable** factors.

-   Regression analysis has to be theoretically sound by ensuring that **key assumptions are validated**.

## Example (exam): think of an experiment (1)

### Can training and education of parents about nutrition reduce children's stunting?

::: fragment
::: callout-warning
### What RCT experiment can help us answer this question?
:::

Let us think of and discuss:

-   An outcome;
-   A treatment;
-   The population;
-   A sample;
-   How to measure the impact of the treatment?

## Example (exam): think of an experiment (2)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: incremental
1.  Outcome variable:

    -   Stunting score of a child.

2.  Treatment variable:

    -   Parents' special training in nutrition.

3.  Targeted population

4.  Samples:

    -   Randomly select eligible subjects.

::: incremental
5.  Randomly assign treatment (communities with training) and control (community without it) groups

6.  Collect the pre-intervention data;

7.  Apply the treatment

8.  Collect the post-intervention data;

9.  Measure the effect

::: fragment
Does the **research design** imply that (if found) education has a causal impact on stunting?

::: incremental
-   Answer:
    -   **Yes!**
    -   All other things are equal because the research design is based on the RCT.
    -   **Training** is the only change between the treatment and control.
:::
:::

## Question 2.

::: fragment
```{r}
# ug_tbl_out
```

**Is the stunting on average less in the treatment compared to the control?**

::: incremental
-   Answer:
    -   The absolute number, yes. **BUT!**
    -   Treatment and control are two different samples from the population.
    -   Means vary naturally for random samples.
    -   We **must apply statistical inference** about the population based on the estimates.
    -   Conclusion: **We do not have sufficient information!**
:::
:::

## Question 3.

::: fragment
```{r}
# ug_tbl_out
```

**Can we recommend education as one of the ways to reduce stunting?**

::: incremental
-   Answer:
    -   If any effect is found, yes! But...
    -   Results are only applicable to the population under investigation.
:::
:::


## Conclusion

```{r}
ug_tbl_out
```

::: fragment
To conclude that

-   two means estimated from different samples

are different (same),

-   we need to perform **statistical inference**!
:::

::: fragment
-   **Without statistical inference, we cannot know what are the chances (odds) that the difference in means is caused by a random variation in samples.**
:::

## Exam questions examples {.smaller}

-   What is the difference between counterfactual and potential outcomes?

-   What is the counterfactual? How is it different from the factual?

-   What do we usually observe in the data, factual or counterfactual?

-   What are the factual and counterfactual in the Urea fertilizers and Rice yields example?

    -   How to generate a counterfactual?

-   What kind of experiment can help answer the questions below? Think about such an experiment and discuss it.

    -   Does the health insurance make people more healthy?
    -   What is the causal effect of fertilizers on yields?
    -   Does going to a private school improv earning?

-   What makes randomized control trials such a powerful tool for revealing the causal effects?

    -   What statistical principles ensure the ceteris paribus under the RCT?

-   Give examples of measurable and not measurable factors that need to remain fixed in order to reveal the causal effect of fertilizer application on crop yields.
