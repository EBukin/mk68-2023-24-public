# Hypothesis testing

A statistical hypothesis test is a **method of statistical inference** used to decide **whether the data** at hand **sufficiently supports a particular hypothesis**.

::: fragment
> Hypothesis testing **allows us to make probabilistic statements about population parameters**.

## Hypothesis testing

::: fragment
### What?

::: incremental
-   Hypothesis Test: A statistical test of the **null hypothesis** against an **alternative hypothesis** [@wooldridge2020introductory].
:::
:::

::: fragment
### Why?

::: incremental
-   We never know the true parameters of the population.
-   We must infer about the population from samples.
-   HT establishes certainty behind our inference (probability or an error).
:::
:::

::: fragment
### How?

::: incremental
-   Following Neyman-Pearson's [@Neyman1933] approach to hypothesis testing.
:::
:::

## Neyman-Pearson's approach

::: incremental
-   assumes that we can perform an infinite number of repeated sampling based on population;

-   aims to **minimize errors of making a false conclusion about the relationship**

-   controls the probability of making an error, when we say "**we reject**" the **Null** hypothesis;
:::

## Hypothesis Testing: Steps

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: incremental
1.  $H_0$: Null/Zero Hypothesis;

    -   $H_0 : \mu = 0$

2.  $H_1$: Alternative Hypothesis;

    -   $H_1 : \mu \ne 0$

3.  **Estimate parameters**:

    -   $\hat \mu = \widehat{\text{mean}}$ , and
    -   $s = \widehat{\text{SD}}$

4.  **Compute the test statistics**;
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: incremental
5.  **Conclude:**

    -   **to reject** $H_0 = \text{accept}\, H_1$, or

    -   **fail to reject** $H_0 = \text{accept}\, H_0$

6.  **Calculate probabilities** of making an error.

    -   probability value (aka "p-value")

## Hypothesis Testing may result in two errors

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: fragment
### Type I error

-   false positive

-   probability value: "p-value"
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: fragment
### Type II error

-   false negative
:::
:::
:::

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: fragment
The error of rejecting $H_0$, when $H_0$ is the `TRUE` hypothesis
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: fragment
The error of accepting $H_0$, when $H_0$ is the `FALSE` hypothesis

::: fragment
::: callout-important
#### NEVER KNOWN to the researchers!
:::
:::
:::
:::
:::

## `p-value` probability value

::: incremental
Neyman-Pearson's approach to HT suggests:

-   reject $H_0$, when

-   p-value (probability of the **Type I error**)

-   is below [the **level of significance** $\alpha$]{style="color: red;"}.
:::

::: fragment
That means:

-   when we reject $H_0$, the probability that we've made a mistake is below $\alpha$
:::

::: fragment
Thus, [**we reject** $H_0$ **only and only if** $\text{p-value} < \alpha$]{style="color: red;"}.
:::

## $\alpha$ is the level of significance

-   Maximum probability of a Type I error in hypothesis testing.

-   In social sciences, the level of significance should not be higher than 5% ($\alpha = 0.05$).

## Example (exam): HT about stunting (1)

Can training and education of parents about nutrition reduce children's stunting?

::: fragment
Our data measures change in stunting levels between pre- and post-training for 500 individuals.
:::

::: fragment
Answer the following questions:

-   Formulate H0 and H1.

-   Provide examples of the Type I and Type II errors in the context of your hypothesis.
:::

## Solutions

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
::: fragment
Null hypothesis: - $H_0:{\Delta}_{\text{stunting}} = 0$

Alternative hypothesis: - $H_1:{\Delta}_{\text{stunting}} \ne 0$ - $H_1:{\Delta}_{\text{stunting}} > 0$ - $H_1:{\Delta}_{\text{stunting}} < 0$
:::
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
::: fragment
-   Type I error:

    -   We conclude **to reject** $H_0$: ${\Delta}_{\text{stunting}}\ne 0$,

    -   But this observation is caused **by a random variation in the sample**.

    -   In the population, training had nothing to do with stunting.

    -   Repeated sampling will probably fail to show a difference.

-   Type II error:

    -   We conclude **to accept** $H_0$: stunting rate did not change after training.

    -   Training helped but, e.g., the food shortage deepened the malnutrition problem in the survey year.

## Example (2): HT about ravens' color

### Question: What % of ravens are White?

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
::: fragment
[Hypothesis:]{style="color: blue;"}

::: incremental
-   $H_0:$ White ravens make up 0% of the population
-   $H_1:$ Share of white raven is not zero (\> 0%)
:::
:::
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
::: fragment
[Data:]{style="color: green;"}

::: incremental
-   we went to a park;
-   we saw 100 ravens (or crows);
-   **no white ravens**!
:::
:::
:::
:::

::: fragment
**Results: the share of white ravens is 0!**
:::

::: fragment
[Conclusion: **fail to reject** $H_0$ (**Accept** $H_0$ )]{style="color: red;"}
:::

::: notes
Was this a random sampling?
:::

## Example (2): Raven color

### [Conclusion: **Accept** $H_0$ (there are no white ravens)]{style="color: red;"}

::: fragment
Did we make any errors? If yes, which one?

::: incremental
-   We've made the **type II error: false negative**.
:::
:::

::: fragment
**Because:**

::: incremental
-   We do not know if $H_0$ is a true hypothesis.
-   We did not use theory (did not study ornithology).
-   [The theory has to justify our choice of the $H_0$.]{style="color: red;"}

## Homework on hypothesis testing {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
For the research questions below:

1.  Describe how would you measure the outcome variable.
2.  Formulate H0 and H1.
3.  Discuss Type I and Type II errors in the context of your hypothesis.
4.  Provide examples of the factors, which could cause these errors to appear.
5.  Think of an RCT experiment that could help answer these questions.

Research questions:

-   What is the difference between the demographic characteristics of individuals in the control and treatment groups?

    -   The characteristics are:age, weight, height, income, number of children, household size...
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   How students' performance in a class is different between years?

-   Are the wheat yields higher in the farms that use precision agriculture?
:::
:::

## Exam questions examples (2) {.smaller}

-   Formulate H0 and H1.

-   Provide an example of a type I / II error relevant to the hypothesis.

-   What are the type I/II errors?

-   Which error type is not known to the researcher that operates observational data? Why?

-   When do we reject the null hypothesis? What kind of error we are trying to minimize?

-   What is the significance level?

# Examples of Hypothesis Testing

The paper [@Kuchenbecker2017] aimed to assess the potential of community-based nutrition education to improve height-for-age z-scores in children 6--23 months of age.

-   The authors performed the RCT experiment in Malawi over 5 years.

-   Data was collected for the control and treatment groups in the baseline and the end-line.

## @Kuchenbecker2017

::: incremental
-   If the paper finds a difference between nutrition statuses in the control and treatment groups, does it mean that education has a causal effect on nutrition?

    -   Yes, if treatment and control groups are the same on average in other factors.

    -   Such factors are Income, Education level, HH size, Farming abilities, ...
:::

## Checks and balances

::: incremental
-   How to identify if the factors are NOT DIFFERENT between the two groups?

    -   Perform statistical hypothesis testing.

    -   Formulate the hypothesis:

        -   H0: a factor is the same across the two groups.
        -   H1: a factor changes between two groups.

    -   Fail to reject H0, when there is no difference
:::

## Checks and balances table

This is an essential table that evaluates if the treatment and control groups of the RCT are the same on average.

::: incremental
The table shows:

-   estimated mean and SD in the control and treatment groups;

-   statistical test about the difference in means;

-   probability value of the type I error;

::: fragment
-   Formulate H0 and H1 about each variable.

-   Perform statistical HT about the mean difference.

-   Conclude if this variable is the same between the treatment and control groups.
:::

## Balance of the HH size

![](img/Kuchenbecker2017-t1-2.png){fig-align="center"}

::: incremental
-   H0: Average household size is equal between Control and treatment;

    -   $H_0: \text{HH Size}_{\text{Control}} = \text{HH Size}_{\text{Treatment}}$

-   H0: Average HH size is unequal

    -   $H_1: \text{HH Size}_{\text{Control}} \ne \text{HH Size}_{\text{Treatment}}$

-   Probability of the type I error: 0.49 (p-value)

-   Fail to reject $H_0$.

-   The difference between C and I is insignificant at the 5% level of significance.
:::

## Remember

The checks and balances table must indicate that treatment and control groups are similar on average.

-   If they are not, simple means comparison will not reveal the causal effect of a treatment.

## How to identify if the intervention helped?

Because @Kuchenbecker2017 is an RCT, we can:

::: incremental
-   Compare means of the outcome variable between two groups, by

-   Performing statistical hypothesis testing (same as in checks and balances),

-   But instead of looking for failing to reject the $H_0$, look for a significant difference.
